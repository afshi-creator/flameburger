            <h2>Meat 100% Purity</h2>
            <p>
                Our commitment to quality and flavor is unwavering.
                100% purity is the reason why all our beef burger taste so delicious. 
                They are made from halal beef cuts with no additives or preservatives.
                Chicken that we serve is carefully deboned breast meat only,
                with seasoned batter and a choice of sauce portions, while our
                Spicy McCrispy Chicken Deluxe uses only muscle cuts. 
                All relevant authorities monitor our high quality standards of halal chicken.
